## Why SfM has anything to do with NeRF?

![drawings-02 001](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3dcd8d3-35cb-403b-998d-64256b21ba06)

NeRF needs cameras positions to cast rays into the scene and render 3D to compute the training loss. Without SfM, NeRF would be shooting rays into the wild.
A nice thing to have if we can do end to end training from 2D images all the way to 3D reconstruction.

### Epipolar Geometry

![Screenshot 2025-01-11 at 3 02 25 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6caa6dfb-2813-4004-8026-c4b36d6caf1e)
> source: (Hartley and Zisserman, 2004)

In simple words: the ray that passes through $x$ is projected onto the second view as $l \prime$. This is very important as it limits the search of $X$ in the second view to $l \prime$.

### The Essential Matrix $E$

### Remarks about Two-View Geometry
* If we have enough correspondences (3D points projected onto two views) we can estimate the fundamental matrix $F$. Actually, we only need 8 corresponding image points, hence the name (Eight-point algorithm).
* With the fundamental matrix $F$, we can guess the camera matrices $K$ and $K\prime$ and get the essential matrix $E$.
* The process of computing a 3D point $X$ is called triangulation.

### Initialization
#### Choosing the initial pair of images

these notes were taken from: [incremental_mapper_impl.h](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/cb02ca13a57e565c6bfb56f5f88d65dab222cd7b/src/colmap/sfm/incremental_mapper_impl.h)

Colmap implements an incremental SfM using three files:
* [incremental_pipeline.cc](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/cb02ca13a57e565c6bfb56f5f88d65dab222cd7b/src/colmap/controllers/incremental_pipeline.cc) under  `colmap/src/colmap/controllers/incremental_pipeline.cc`.
* [incremental_mapper.cc](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/cb02ca13a57e565c6bfb56f5f88d65dab222cd7b/src/colmap/sfm/incremental_mapper.cc) under `colmap/src/colmap/sfm/incremental_mapper.cc`.
* [incremental_mapper_impl.cc](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/cb02ca13a57e565c6bfb56f5f88d65dab222cd7b/src/colmap/sfm/incremental_mapper_impl.cc) under `colmap/src/colmap/sfm/incremental_mapper_impl.cc`.


The function `InitializeReconstruction` inside `colmap/src/colmap/controllers/incremental_pipeline.cc` initializes the reconstruction by calling `FindInitialImagePair` in `colmap/src/colmap/sfm/incremental_mapper.cc`

![drawings-02 003](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d1da6e4-0df3-4662-8a64-5323148f6f0b)

Large number of correspondences would make it easy to pair it with a second image, and having camera calibration priors would allow colmap to use the essential matrix $E$ to estimate the camera poses.

#### Estimating two view geometry between the initial pair
In addition to [incremental_pipeline.cc](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/cb02ca13a57e565c6bfb56f5f88d65dab222cd7b/src/colmap/controllers/incremental_pipeline.cc), [incremental_mapper.cc](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/cb02ca13a57e565c6bfb56f5f88d65dab222cd7b/src/colmap/sfm/incremental_mapper.cc), and [incremental_mapper_impl.cc](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/cb02ca13a57e565c6bfb56f5f88d65dab222cd7b/src/colmap/sfm/incremental_mapper_impl.cc) we have two more files to estimate two view geometry between the initial pair of images:

* [two_view_geometry.cc](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/cb02ca13a57e565c6bfb56f5f88d65dab222cd7b/src/colmap/estimators/two_view_geometry.cc) under `colmap/src/colmap/estimators/two_view_geometry.cc`.
* [essential_matrix.cc](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/cb02ca13a57e565c6bfb56f5f88d65dab222cd7b/src/colmap/geometry/essential_matrix.cc) under `colmap/src/colmap/geometry/essential_matrix.cc`.
* [pose.cc](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/cb02ca13a57e565c6bfb56f5f88d65dab222cd7b/src/colmap/geometry/pose.cc) under `colmap/src/colmap/geometry/pose.cc`.

![drawings-02 004](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccb9a508-3fdb-4325-932c-1da8d1e3f77a)

* `EstimateCalibratedTwoViewGeometry`: estimates two-view geometry from calibrated image pair. 
  * Extract corresponding points
  * Estimate epipolar models
  * Estimate planar or panoramic model
  * Determine inlier ratios of different models
* `EstimateTwoViewGeometryPose`: estimates relative pose for two-view geometry.
```cc
  // Try to recover relative pose for calibrated and uncalibrated
  // configurations. In the uncalibrated case, this most likely leads to a
  // ill-defined reconstruction, but sometimes it succeeds anyways after e.g.
  // subsequent bundle-adjustment etc.
```
* `PoseFromEssentialMatrix`: recovers the most probable pose from the given essential matrix.
```cc
// Decompose an essential matrix into the possible rotations and translations.
//
// The first pose is assumed to be P = [I | 0] and the set of four other
// possible second poses are defined as: {[R1 | t], [R2 | t],
//                                        [R1 | -t], [R2 | -t]}
//
// @param E          3x3 essential matrix.
// @param R1         First possible 3x3 rotation matrix.
// @param R2         Second possible 3x3 rotation matrix.
// @param t          3x1 possible translation vector (also -t possible).
```
* `CheckCheirality`
```cc
// Perform cheirality constraint test, i.e., determine which of the triangulated
// correspondences lie in front of both cameras.
//
// @param cam2_from_cam1  Relative camera transformation.
// @param points1         First set of corresponding points.
// @param points2         Second set of corresponding points.
// @param points3D        Points that lie in front of both cameras.
```

### Image Registration
> New images can be registered to the current model by solving the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem using feature correspondences to triangulated points in already registered images (2D-3D correspondences). The PnP problem involves estimating the pose $P_c$ and, for uncalibrated cameras, its intrinsic parameters. The set $𝒫$ is thus extended by the pose $P_c$ of the newly registered image (Schönberger and Frahm, 2016). 

![drawings-02 005](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f8d7a7b-13ce-4760-b1d1-885d60162125)

* `FindNextImages`: sort images in a way that prioritize images with a sufficient number of visible points.
* `RegisterNextImage`
  * search for 2D-3D correspondences
  * estimate camera parameters
  * pose refinement
  * extend tracks to the newly registered image

### Triangulation
> A newly registered image must observe existing scene points. In addition, it may also increase scene coverage by extending the set of points $𝒳$ through triangulation. A new scene point $X_k$ can be triangulated and added to $𝒳$ as soon as at least one more image, also covering the new scene part but from a different viewpoint, is registered (Schönberger and Frahm, 2016).

![drawings-02 006](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86886fd8-067a-4e29-a863-a223c0ab119c)

### Bundle Adjustment
> Without further refinement, SfM usually drifts quickly to a non-recoverable state. Bundle adjustment is the joint non-linear refinement of camera parameters $P_c$ and point parameters $X_k$ that minimizes the reprojection error:
>
> $E = \sum_j \rho_j \Big( \left\lVert \pi (P_c, X_k) - x_j \right\rVert^{2}_{2} \Big)$
>
> * $\pi$: a function that projects scene points to image space
> * $\rho_j$: the Cauchy function as the robust loss function to potentially down-weight outliers

![drawings-02 007](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60f7aea7-444f-4378-915c-52a2e9b1b12f)

* `IterativeLocalRefinement`: iteratively calls `AdjustLocalBundle`
* `AdjustLocalBundle`
```cc
  // Adjust locally connected images and points of a reference image. In
  // addition, refine the provided 3D points. Only images connected to the
  // reference image are optimized. If the provided 3D points are not locally
  // connected to the reference image, their observing images are set as
  // constant in the adjustment.
```
* `IterativeGlobalRefinement`: iteratively calls `AdjustGlobalBundle`
* `AdjustGlobalBundle`: Global bundle adjustment using Ceres Solver, which is usually used to solve Non-linear Least Squares problems.

## VGGSfM
From (Wang et al., 2024) appendix A, the training process involves multiple stages:

> source: (Yang et al., 2020)

---

#### The tracking process:
1. [`runner.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/runners/runner.py) calls [`track_predictor.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/models/track_predictor.py) in `predict_tracks` or `predict_tracks_in_chunks` avoid memory issues.
   > runner.py line 1315
   
   ```python
      fine_pred_track, _, pred_vis, pred_score = track_predictor(
          images_feed,
          split_points,
          fmaps=fmaps_feed,
          fine_tracking=fine_tracking,
      )
   ```
2. [`track_predictor.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/models/track_predictor.py) calls [`base_track_predictor.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/models/track_modules/base_track_predictor.py) twice, one for `coarse_predictor` and another for `fine_predictor`.
   > track_predictor.py line 91
   
   ```python
      # Coarse prediction
      coarse_pred_track_lists, pred_vis = self.coarse_predictor(
          query_points=query_points,
          fmaps=fmaps,
          iters=coarse_iters,
          down_ratio=self.coarse_down_ratio,
      )
      coarse_pred_track = coarse_pred_track_lists[-1]
   ```
3. [`base_track_predictor.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/models/track_modules/base_track_predictor.py) takes query points and their feature maps as inputs and returns 2D positions and visibility:
   1. input
       ```python
        """
        query_points: B x N x 2, the number of batches, tracks, and xy
        fmaps: B x S x C x HH x WW, the number of batches, frames, and feature dimension.
                note HH and WW is the size of feature maps instead of original images
        """
      ```
   1. Inside an iterative refinement loop, it samples discriptors from all frames $N_I$ starting from the position of query points at the reference frame $I_i$. It does that by calling `CorrBlock` from [`blocks.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/models/track_modules/blocks.py)
      ```python
      # Compute the correlation (check the implementation of CorrBlock)
      if self.efficient_corr:
          fcorrs = fcorr_fn.sample(coords, track_feats)
      else:
          fcorr_fn.corr(track_feats)
          fcorrs = fcorr_fn.sample(coords)  # B, S, N, corrdim
      ```
   2. It passes `query_points` $`\{ \hat{y}_1^i, \cdots, \hat{y}_1^{N_T} \}`$, `correlations` $`V \in ℝ^{N_T \times N_I \times C}`$ , and `track_feats` $`\{ m_1^i, \cdots, m_1^{N_T} \}`$ to a transformer named `EfficientUpdateFormer` in [`blocks.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/models/track_modules/blocks.py).
       ```python
       # Concatenate them as the input for the transformers
       transformer_input = torch.cat(
           [flows_emb, fcorrs_, track_feats_], dim=2
       )
       ```      
   2. output
       ```python
        if return_feat:
            return coord_preds, vis_e, track_feats, query_track_feat
        else:
            return coord_preds, vis_e
       ```

### Camera Initializer
In (Wang et al., 2024) paper they mentioned that the camera initializer was designed as follows:

![Screenshot 2025-01-10 at 3 40 35 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09490f31-b3d8-424b-a253-1e62721191bd)
> source: (Wang et al., 2024)

---

But at the time of writing, the camera initializer does not use track features in the code to make it faster. This was mentioned in the [issues](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/issues/48).

<!--
![Screenshot 2025-01-10 at 3 42 48 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2969873c-6c91-481f-a9ac-e7071c351cc1)
> source: https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/issues/48
-->

So here's how the camera initializer is implemented in the code:
1. [`runner.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/runners/runner.py) calls [`camera_predictor.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/models/camera_predictor.py) using `self.camera_predictor`, which passes image features to a transformer and refine the camera poses iteratively:
      > camera_predictor.py line 187
      
      ```python
        for iter_num in range(iters):
            pred_pose_enc = pred_pose_enc.detach()

            # Embed the camera parameters and add to rgb_feat
            pose_embed = self.embed_pose(pred_pose_enc)
            rgb_feat = rgb_feat + pose_embed

            # Run trunk transformers on rgb_feat
            rgb_feat = self.trunk(rgb_feat)

            # Predict the delta feat and pose encoding at each iteration
            delta = self.pose_branch(rgb_feat)
            delta_pred_pose_enc = delta[..., : self.target_dim]
            delta_feat = delta[..., self.target_dim :]

            rgb_feat = self.ffeat_updater(self.norm(delta_feat)) + rgb_feat

            pred_pose_enc = pred_pose_enc + delta_pred_pose_enc

            # Residual connection
            rgb_feat = (rgb_feat + rgb_feat_init) / 2
      ```
   
1. [`runner.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/runners/runner.py) calls [`estimate_preliminary.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/two_view_geo/estimate_preliminary.py) using `estimate_preliminary_cameras_poselib` or `estimate_preliminary_cameras`. The difference was mentioned in the comments:
      > runner.py line 474
      
      ```python
        # Estimate preliminary_cameras by recovering fundamental/essential/homography matrix from 2D matches
        # By default, we use fundamental matrix estimation with 7p/8p+LORANSAC
        # All the operations are batched and differentiable (if necessary)
        # except when you enable use_poselib to save GPU memory
        _, preliminary_dict = estimate_preliminary_cameras_fn(
            pred_track,
            pred_vis,
            width,
            height,
            tracks_score=pred_score,
            max_error=self.cfg.fmat_thres,
            loopresidual=True,
        )
      ```
      [`estimate_preliminary.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/two_view_geo/estimate_preliminary.py) performs three main tasks
      1. Estimate Fundamental Matrix by Batch `fmat: (B*(S-1))x3x3`, where `S` is the number of frames. [`fundamental.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/two_view_geo/fundamental.py) estimates the fundamental matrix by 7pt/8pt algo + LORANSAC and returns the one with the highest inlier number.
      2. Estimate `kmat1, kmat2: (B*(S-1))x3x3`, where focal length is set as max(width, height), and the principal point is set as (width//2, height//2).
      3. Get Essential matrix from Fundamental and Camera matrices.

### Triangulator
In (Wang et al., 2024) paper they mentioned that they used a transformer for the triangulator:

![Screenshot 2025-01-11 at 2 21 57 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b234fccf-4dfb-4719-a004-635e65c7fe7b)
> source: (Wang et al., 2024)

---

But at the time of writing, the learnable parameters were removed from the triangulator in the code to simplify inference. This was mentioned in the [issues](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/issues/47).

<!--
![Screenshot 2025-01-11 at 2 22 31 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4ce5d64-0e1e-41fa-9e1f-581dc5e5f5be)
> source: https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/issues/47
-->

So here's how the triangulator is implemented in the code:
1. [`runner.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/runners/runner.py) calls [`triangulator.py`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm/blob/main/vggsfm/models/triangulator.py) using `self.triangulator`, which uses RANSAC Direct Linear Transforms (DLT) to triangulate and bundle adjust.
      > triangulator.py line 122
      
      ```python
         # For initialization
         # we first triangulate a point cloud for each pair of query-reference images,
         # i.e., we have S-1 3D point clouds
         # points_3d_pair: S-1 x N x 3
         (points_3d_pair, cheirality_mask_pair, triangle_value_pair) = (
             triangulate_by_pair(extrinsics[None], tracks_normalized[None])
         )

         # Check which point cloud can provide sufficient inliers
         # that pass the triangulation angle and cheirality check

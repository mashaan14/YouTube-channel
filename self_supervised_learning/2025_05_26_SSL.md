## SwAV

SwAV added a layer to cluster the images. Their motivation was to avoid the costly pairwise assignment of positive and negative pairs.

> Comparing cluster assignments allows to contrast different image views while not relying on explicit pairwise feature comparisons.

SwAV uses multi-crop training, where the image is cropped into smaller sizes.

> In this work, we propose multi-crop that uses smaller-sized images to increase the number of views while not increasing the memory or computational requirements during training.

## DINOv1

DINOv1 utilized the power of vision transformers and replaced the ConvNet backbone used in previous works.

> In this work, inspired from these methods, we study the impact of self-supervised pretraining on ViT features. Of particular interest, we have identified several interesting properties that do not emerge with supervised ViTs, nor with convnets:
> * Self-supervised ViT features explicitly contain the scene layout and, in particular, object boundaries, as shown in Figure 1. This information is directly accessible in the self-attention modules of the last block.
> * Self-supervised ViT features perform particularly well with a basic nearest neighbors classifier (k-NN) without any finetuning, linear classifier nor data augmentation, achieving 78.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

## iBOT

iBOT paper introduces the concept of masked patch token and designed a loss for this.

> The target network is fed with a masked image while the online tokenizer with the original image. The goal is to let the target network recover each masked patch token to its corresponding tokenizer output. Our online tokenizer naturally resolves two major challenges.
> * On the one hand, our tokenizer captures highlevel visual semantics progressively learned by enforcing the similarity of cross-view images on class tokens.
> * On the other hand, our tokenizer needs no extra stages of training as pre-processing setup since it is jointly optimized with MIM via momentum update.

## DINOv2
DINOv2 used a similar architecture as iBOT but with some changes. The most notable change was the dataset; they used the LVD-142M dataset, which is much larger than ImageNet-22K. Another change was the use of separate heads for DINO and iBOT. 

> In Zhou et al. (2022a), an ablation study shows that sharing parameters between the DINO and iBOT heads leads to better performance. At scale, we observed that the opposite is true, and we therefore use two separate heads in all our experiments.

They also trained on full-resolution $518 \times 518$-pixel images.
